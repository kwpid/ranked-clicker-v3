🔹 Timing & Access

The RCCS happens one week before the end of each season.

Only players Champion III or higher can sign up.

When a season starts, a persistent notification appears:

Player must sign up or decline to clear it.

Add a console command to force start a season (for testing/debug).

🔹 Tournament Flow

Format: 3v3, RLCS-style system with qualifiers, regionals, majors, and worlds.

Each team = 3 players (player + 2 AI).

About 128 AI teams compete per qualifier.

Higher average team MMR = higher chance of success.

Example: A team avg. of 3,800 MMR is “pro-level” and usually makes Worlds.
